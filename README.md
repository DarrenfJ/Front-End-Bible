# The Front End Bible
The ultimate resource for Front-End developers new and old, this is a repository of tips and tricks with easy to follow guides to get them up and running on your website. 

### Get Started
To get started and start browsing through the various snippets of code to add to your project, find the relevant folder above. The names of each file will be relevant for what is inside, and when there is enough files submitted we will create sub-folders _for example: animations, typography, borders etc etc_. 
Inside each file, you will find a commented section. This will contain the relevant information on how to implement each snippet of code into your file. If there is any other code necessary it will be included.

### Contribute
Every contribution is gratefully recieved no matter how simple or complicated. If this is your first time contributing to a repository, then simply fork the repo and push your code with a relevant file name. If anything needs changing then I will change to suit.

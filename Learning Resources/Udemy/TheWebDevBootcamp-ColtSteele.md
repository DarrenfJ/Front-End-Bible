# The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele
This course is one that everyone learning Web Development will mention, and for good reason. Personally, I don't think there is
any other course that offers the complete package in a style as good as Colt's course.

Taking you from the absolute basics, it covers everything from HTML/CSS to DOM manipulation, JQuery and back-end technologies.
This is a man that is used to teaching, and you can clearly tell over other courses that are constructed by people who are
not necessarily lecturers as a main job.

Udemy often have the course on sale for under Â£10, and at that price it is an absolute steal, and I would recommend it to
any new budding developers, or even developers who want to hone their basic skills.
